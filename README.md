# Open Source Business Application
Demo application with **[Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)** and **[Eclipse Scout](http://www.eclipse.org/scout/) UI**

**Please Note**: This is work in progress and has not (yet) been tested for productive usage.

## Application Description
Minimal but fully functioning business application
* Business use case: Task management
* Administration use case: User, role and permission management
* Interfaces: Both UI and REST API

### Application Login
When running from within Eclipse, open your browser at [localhost](http://localhost:8080). The login dialog then appears as shown below. You may use root/eclipse as login/password for the development environment. The other default users are alice/test and bob/test.
